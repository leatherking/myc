# Lecture 1
## Continual AI
- *ContinualAI Research (CLAIR)* is the research consortium powered by ContinualAI, with the goal of supporting coordination and collaboration among continual learning labs across the world.
## Intro to CL
- Catastrophic Forgetting (OR Interference)
    
    Mostly due to Gradient Descent
